# scholars-on-twitter

This repo contains a RMarkdown file with the **deprecated code** used to create a [first, now obsolete, version](https://zenodo.org/records/7013518) of a dataset of about 500,000 pairs of OpenAlex author IDs and Twitter (X) accounts, as reported in Mongeon, P., Bowman, T. D., & Costas, R. (2023). An open data set of scholars on Twitter. Quantitative Science Studies, 4(2), 314â€“324. [https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00250](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00250). 

Following changes to the author IDs in the OpenAlex database and changes to the Twitter (X) API, while the original process cannot be reproduced, we did create a [new working version of the dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10905839) that links current OpenAlex author IDs to Twitter (X) accounts using the SQL script included in this repository.
